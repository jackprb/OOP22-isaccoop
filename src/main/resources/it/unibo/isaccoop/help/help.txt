General gameplay information

In the game there are 5 types of rooms:
 - START: the empty room where the player starts
 - SHOP: the room where you can buy powerups, using the money previously collected
 - TREASURE: the room that contains a free power up
 - STANDARD: a room with enemies to defeat
 - BOSS: the room with the final boss (the last room).

A level is made of rooms.
At the bottom left of the game window, there is the "minimap", where you can see some information
about the level you are playing.

A room is completed if there are no more enemies to defeat, (marked in GREEN on the minimap)
otherwise, it is not completed if the are still enemies to defeat (marked in YELLOW on the minimap).
The room you are currently in is marked in RED on the minimap.

The START, SHOP and TREASURE rooms are already completed because there are no enemies there,
whereas STANDARD and BOSS room are not completed because you will have to defeat all enemies
in there.

To defeat an enemy, shoot towards it until it disappears.
Different enemies require a different number of shoots to be defeated.
